# NOTE: Only one of the following parameters is required.
# NOTE: [aoi_tiles] can be used to define the area of interest via MGRS tile IDs. IDs must be provided comma-separated,
# e.g.: 32TNS, 32TMT, 32TMS
# NOTE: [aoi_geometry] defines the area of interest via a full path to a vector file supported by
# `spatialist.vector.Vector`. This option will automatically search for overlapping MGRS tiles and use these for processing.

# NOTE: All parameters ending in '_file' can either be full paths to the existing file OR file names, which are assumed
# to be located in the directory specified with the parameter [work_dir]. The [db_file] is an exception, as it will be
# automatically generated by pyroSAR if it doesn't exist already.
